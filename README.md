My name is Martin Palazzo from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am interested in graph and network processing using representation learning approaches with applications in Operational Research and Molecular Biology domains. Actually I lead an Artificial Intelligence team in the Biotechnology Industry for biomanufacturing technology development at Stamm Biotech. In paralel I teach and develop courses for grad students about Operational Research and Machine Learning at Universidad de San Andres and Universidad Tecnologica Nacional Buenos Aires. 

Previously I developed a thesis named [Dimension reduction in biomedical tumor profiles: a machine learning approach](https://www.theses.fr/2021TROY0031) in the context of the co-tutelle PhD in Engineering program between the Universite de Technologie de Troyes, Universidad Tecnologica Nacional Buenos Aires and Biomedicine Research Institute of Buenos Aires - Max Planck Partner Institute. This thesis is based in the proposal of multiples statistical methods for dimension reduction using Neural Networks and Kernel Methods with applications in multi-omic data from a pan-cancer landscape of tumor profiles. 

Previously I have been studying community detection in dynamic spatio-temporal graphs during the Optimization and Security of Complex systems master degree at Universite de Technologie de Troyes. 

During my industrial engineer degree I have worked in domains such as automotive, massive consumption, internet, energy and music.
