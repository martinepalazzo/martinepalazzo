### Martin Palazzo
I am a PhD student doing a co-supervised program at the Biomedicine Research Institute of Buenos Aires – Max Planck Partner Institute, the National University of Technology BA and the Université de Technologié de Troyes (UTT) in France. My research interests are mainly pattern recognition, machine learning, statistics and bioinformatics.

My research focus lies in the intersection between kernel methods and neural networks applied on biological data from cancer patients. Particularly I use ‘omic’ data, like Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics and Metabolomics. Since the beginning of my PhD program I have been studying and developing feature selection strategies using kernel methods, mainly with Multiple Kernel Learning algorithms. Now my objective is to use the advantages of kernel methods and combine them with neural networks by using kernel mean embeddings to learn robust representation of tumor profiles.

Before, during my Master in Optimization and Complex Systems at UTT I have worked with community detection models using graphs data and network analysis. Particularly I explored spatio-temporal networks using spectral clustering approaches.

My professional experience has a mix of Industry and Science. In the past I have worked 6 years in industry, from big corporations like IBM or AB Inbev to small and agile startups like Streema (more than 10 million MAUs). Also I am an active member of international organisations like the World Economic Forum (Global Shapers community) and in the past at the World Energy Council (Future Energy Leaders program and World Energy Perspectives report).
