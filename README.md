### Martin Palazzo

I am interested in graph and network processing using representation learning approaches with applications in Operational Research and Molecular Biology. Actually I explore these topics in the Biotechnology Industry, developing biomanufacturing technology at Stamm Biotech. In paralel I teach and develop courses for grad students about Operational Research and Machine Learning at Universidad de San Andres and Universidad Tecnologica Nacional Buenos Aires. 

Previously I developed a thesis named 'Dimension reduction in biomedical tumor profiles: a machine learning approach' in the context of the co-tutelle PhD in Engineering program between the Universite de Technologie de Troyes, Universidad Tecnologica Nacional Buenos Aires and Biomedicine Research Institute of Buenos Aires - Max Planck Partner Institute. This thesis is based in the proposal of multiples statistical methods for dimension reduction using Neural Networks and Kernel Methods with applications in multi-omic data from a pan-cancer landscape of tumor profiles. 

Previously I have been studying community detection in dynamic spatio-temporal graphs during the Optimization and Security of Complex systems master degree at Universite de Technologie de Troyes and as an industrial engineer in domains such as automotive, massive consumption and internet.
